## 📊 Detailed Free Tier Analysis

### What AWS Free Tier Gives You (First 12 Months):

| Service | Free Tier Limit | Your Demo Usage | Status |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Lambda** | 1M requests + 400K GB-seconds | ~14K requests | ✅ 1.4% used |
| **DynamoDB** | 25 GB storage + 25 RCU/WCU | ~0.1 GB | ✅ 0.4% used |
| **API Gateway** | 1M HTTP requests | ~5K requests | ✅ 0.5% used |
| **S3** | 5 GB + 20K GET + 2K PUT | 0.05 GB + 1K GET | ✅ 5% used |
| **CloudFront** | 1 TB out + 10M requests | 0.1 GB + 1K req | ✅ 0.01% used |
| **CloudWatch** | 10 metrics + 5 GB logs | 5 metrics + 0.1 GB | ✅ 50% used |
| **EventBridge** | 5M events (always) | ~9K events | ✅ 0.2% used |

**All services well within free tier limits!** ✅

## 💰 After 12 Months (When Free Tier Expires)

### Services That Stay FREE Forever:
✅ **Lambda**: First 1M requests/month + 400K GB-seconds (permanent)
✅ **DynamoDB**: First 25 GB storage (permanent)
✅ **EventBridge**: First 5M events/month (permanent)
✅ **CloudWatch**: 10 custom metrics + 5 GB logs (permanent)

### Services That Become Paid (But Tiny Cost):
- **API Gateway**: $0.01/month (was free for 12 months)
- **S3**: $0.01/month (was free for 12 months)
- **CloudFront**: $0.01/month (was free for 12 months)

**Total After Year 1: $0.03/month (3 cents!)**

---

## 🛡️ Safety Measures to Stay FREE

### 1. Billing Alerts (MUST DO)
```bash
# Set up billing alerts at:
$1.00  - First warning
$5.00  - Second warning
$10.00 - Final warning
```

If you get any alert, something is wrong!

### 2. Cost Monitoring (Weekly Check)
```bash
# Check your AWS bill
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=2025-01-01,End=2025-01-31 \
  --granularity MONTHLY \
  --metrics BlendedCost
```

Expected: $0.00 for first 12 months

### 3. Services to NEVER Enable
❌ **NAT Gateway** - $32.40/month
❌ **Application Load Balancer** - $16.20/month
❌ **RDS** - $15.00/month minimum
❌ **ElastiCache** - $13.00/month minimum
❌ **ECS Fargate** - Pay per hour
❌ **EC2 instances** - Pay per hour

**Our demo uses NONE of these!** ✅

### 4. Data Retention Strategy
**DynamoDB TTL**: Auto-delete metrics older than 30 days
- Keeps storage under 1 GB
- Stays well within 25 GB free tier
- Zero cost ✅

### 5. Collection Frequency Control
**EventBridge Schedule**: Every 5 minutes (reasonable)
- 288 runs/day = 8,640/month
- Well under 1M Lambda free tier
- Can reduce to every 15 minutes if needed

## ⚠️ What Could Cause Costs (And How to Avoid)

### Scenario 1: Accidental NAT Gateway
**Risk**: Someone enables NAT Gateway
**Cost**: $32/month
**Prevention**: Don't create VPC resources, use default VPC
**Our Setup**: No VPC configuration ✅

### Scenario 2: Heavy Traffic Spike
**Risk**: Your demo goes viral (unlikely)
**Cost**: Data transfer costs
**Prevention**: Billing alerts at $5
**Likelihood**: Very low ✅

### Scenario 3: Forgot to Delete Resources
**Risk**: Leave resources running after demo period
**Cost**: Varies
**Prevention**: Document all created resources, easy cleanup script
**Our Plan**: Cleanup script provided ✅

### Scenario 4: Wrong Lambda Memory
**Risk**: Set Lambda to 10 GB memory (max)
**Cost**: Higher compute costs
**Prevention**: Use 512 MB (reasonable)
**Our Setup**: 512 MB configured ✅

### Scenario 5: Data Hoarding
**Risk**: Never delete old metrics, accumulate 100 GB
**Cost**: DynamoDB storage
**Prevention**: TTL auto-delete after 30 days
**Our Setup**: TTL enabled ✅

**All risks mitigated!** ✅

## 🚨 Emergency Shutdown (If Needed)

If you ever see unexpected charges:

```bash
# 1. Stop data collection (delete EventBridge rules)
aws events remove-targets --rule cloudops-collect-metrics --ids "1"
aws events delete-rule --name cloudops-collect-metrics

# 2. Delete Lambda functions
aws lambda delete-function --function-name cloudops-api-gateway
aws lambda delete-function --function-name cloudops-data-collector

# 3. Delete CloudFront distribution
aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID

# 4. Empty and delete S3 bucket
aws s3 rm s3://cloudops-dashboard-demo --recursive
aws s3 rb s3://cloudops-dashboard-demo

# 5. Delete API Gateway
aws apigatewayv2 delete-api --api-id YOUR_API_ID

# Total time: 5 minutes
# Remaining cost: Only DynamoDB (~$0.04/month for stored data)
```
