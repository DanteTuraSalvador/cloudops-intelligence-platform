# AWS CLI Installation Guide

## Quick Installation (5 minutes)

I've already downloaded the AWS CLI installer for you!

### Step 1: Run the Installer

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Dante Salvador\Downloads`
3. Double-click `AWSCLIV2.msi`
4. Click "Next" through the installation wizard
5. Accept the license agreement
6. Click "Install" (may need admin privileges)
7. Click "Finish" when done

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Open a NEW PowerShell window and run:
```powershell
aws --version
```

You should see something like:
```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/3.x.x Windows/10 exe/AMD64
```

### Step 3: Configure AWS Credentials

You already have credentials in `rootkey.csv`. Let's configure them:

```powershell
aws configure
```

When prompted, enter:
```
AWS Access Key ID: [from rootkey.csv - column 1]
AWS Secret Access Key: [from rootkey.csv - column 2]
Default region name: ap-southeast-2
Default output format: json
```

### Step 4: Test AWS CLI

```powershell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see your AWS account information.

## Alternative: Manual Download (if installer didn't work)

If you need to download it again:

1. Go to: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
2. Download the installer
3. Run the MSI file
4. Follow the installation wizard

## Troubleshooting

### "aws is not recognized"

**Solution**: Close and reopen PowerShell after installation
- The PATH is updated during installation
- Existing PowerShell windows won't see the new PATH

### Need Admin Privileges

**Solution**: Right-click AWSCLIV2.msi → "Run as administrator"

### Already Installed

**Solution**: Just configure your credentials:
```powershell
aws configure
```

## After AWS CLI is Installed

Once `aws --version` works, you're ready to deploy!

Run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Dante Salvador\Downloads\CloudOps Intelligence Platform"
.\deployment\deploy.ps1
```

This will deploy your entire platform to AWS in 3-5 minutes!
